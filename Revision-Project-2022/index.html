    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> Right here in the Richmond region, an eclectic culture has popped up through the cobblestones. Here, murals
      cover the walls of local restaurants and shops. We have charming neighborhoods like the Fan District, which was
      named one of The South’s Best Neighborhoods by Southern Living. Major art museums draw national attention.
      Artisans share their talents in shops and markets. Food is an art here, too. In fact, National Geographic put us
      on their list of the world’s – yep, the world’s -- “top 10 places to travel for food.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Running through it all: the James River. You can whitewater raft through downtown on its class III and IV rapids.
      Bike the Virginia Capital Trail – it runs right alongside the James. Or, just hang out on the river rocks with
      your dog.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re a place of stories, with 300+ historic markers to prove it. A place of architectural eye candy. A place
      where you can drive from one great experience to another, and it’s within a day of most of the east coast. So read
      on. Dive in like a local. Don’t know where to start? Let’s get creative.
